# Split Array With Same Average

*Credit: this problem is adapted from [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/split-array-with-same-average/).*

In a given integer array A, we must move every element of A to either list B or list C. (B and C initially start empty.)

Return true if and only if after such a move, it is possible that the average value of B is equal to the average value of C, and B and C are both non-empty.

Note:

- The length of `A` will be in the range `[1, 30]`.
- `A[i]` will be in the range of `[0, 10000]`.
