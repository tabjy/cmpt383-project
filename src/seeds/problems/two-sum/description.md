# Two Sum

*Credit: this problem is adapted from [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/).*

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to
`target`.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Constraints:

- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^3`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9` 
- Only one valid answer exists.
